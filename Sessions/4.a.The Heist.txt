4.a The Heist

Assuming the players accept Toth'tways deal this is how the mission will go.

Toth'tway will need the day to prepare, and the plan has a better chance of succeding at night, so he will ask the players to wait a day, he will also ask callum for a boon as he was the only one that didn't participate in the slaughter.

The players will have free roam on the island for the last day, under the guise of letting them prepare for their banishment, this will let them restock on consumables they wont have access to.

The Ships will be held in a small dock on one of the smaller islands surrounding the central island, basically a impound lot for ships under quarrenteen, needing refurbishment, or any other reason where it taking up space on the main docks is a bad idea. The players will either have to go through the main door to the island, and risk being seen. Charm their way onto the island to avoid combat, or they can glide onto it using the Aetheric Wings that they have recovered in their adventures.

The island will be populated by mechanical workers governed by a warforged Captain called v1.1.1a. He will have a crew of 6 guards, and 20 workers.

	V1.1.1a +2 Insight, +4 Perception
	Guards +2 Perception
	Workers --,

Once on the boat they will be home free, and will find a note directing them to a island about a days journey away.
	- The island will be a heavily wooded island with a hollowed out volcano shaft running through the centre. The shaft will be just big enough to hide the 'Curse' and a single badly damaged wooden dock with a warforged on it will run around the edge. The warforged will introduce himself as Agent v13.5.1q, callsign Quartermaster. He will be their contact with Toth'Tway, as well as being able to help procure certain requistions.
	
	He will also be willing to trade elemental hearts or other rare items for magic items "recovered" from toth'tways discarded experiements
	
	The first mission Toth'tway gives them will be the same as the one he forced upon them if they refused the pirate deal, see 4.b Recompense (If they decide to try and decode the Navigation charts make something up)
