4. Redeption Summary

The players woke up and after meeting with friedrich they got escorted to see Toth'Tway.

He apolagized for over reacting last night, and as a apology he gave Callum a gift [Bag of Holding], and offered them the deal to either work for him, or do one last job before going on their own way.

The players asked for more time, and were escorted to the tavern/inn to discuss. 
	The party was a larely even split between either option, and decided to ask if they could decide after the mission
		Throught the discussion Kai was fairly insulting towards Toth'Tway
		They also implied they make just take the offer and run anyway
	
When they returned to Toth'Tway he refused their suggestion of giving them more time, and they ended up agreeing to secretly worl for Toth'tway.
	
Toth'Tway then left to set up the escape, as the players went to the apothacary [Angelus], and the Quatermaster [Gloin], Angelus offered them some of the better potions and discounts if the players would be able to get her some illicit substances under the table
	Starleaf
	Nirnroot
	Blackroot,
	If the players manage to get the supplies to captain Morgan, with the message [Tonic for Angelus], if should get to her eventually, and she would send the potions back by the same root.
	
	Kai insulted Toth'tway in front of both of the vendors, but Heracles smoothed things over so they were still willing to sell to the party.
	
	After the shopping trip, the players returns to the Throneroom, asked basically no questions and then left to the island, realizing it was still to early, they immedietly returned to their chambers, leaving Heracles in the throne room, Heracles asked some questions about the Island they were going to raid, and Friedrich suggested gliding down.
	
	Heracles said hed ask the party, the met back up in the chambers, and Insizor and Edward were willing, Patlas and Kai less so. The 3 willing spent the rest of the day training with 1.6.3 to use the wings
	
	Come evening they glided onto the island, got split up as they were not that experienced.
		Insizor and Edward landed together and got noticed, but convinced v1.1.1 they were on a mission from Toth'tway, so he let them take a boat, they sailed around and waited for patlas and kai, while cal was hiding near the Curse. When patlas and Kai came through the portal on the island, they let slip something was up, and 1's started to attack. Heracles used the distraction to sneak onto the "Curse" and activate the engines. He then shot a harpoon into the smugglinh ship the others were on, and after a brief fight were only automatons were injured, they fled.
		
10 days of uneventful travel passed, and when they got to the island, they had a brief tour, a brief investigation and hid the ships in the hollow pocket after meating 13.X.X and calling him something after charlie Angels
