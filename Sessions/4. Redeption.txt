The session will start after the long rest of the night before with all the players waking up in their beds, Pat notices that his arm is in accute pain, and he notices that his right hand to the elbow has been replaced with a clockwork arm silimar to what Toth'Tway has.

When they wake up, Friedrich will enter the chamber and ask the players to follow him, he will take them to Toth'tways Lab. Where Toth'tway is working on the orb that they had given him last night.

	Toth'Tway will start expositing that this seems to be a normal heart, but it seems to have been awakened in some way, that somehow the heart has been "seeded" with a portion of divine power, and that he thinks that with enough of them, and a large enough variety of them, you could reawaken a God, in this case probably Ba'al. 
	
	While I cannot condone your methods, I cannot fault your results. After considering it over tonight, I am going to have to change my offer to you. You are all expelled from university, with all rights stripped from you. I cannot have agents whos willful joy of destruction causes them to hurt my own people.
	
	I Also need to apologize, while I think my rage was earned, I took it to far, and endangered the weaves of reality, something that me and my kind have swarn never to do, as a apology, and a reward for not partaking in the wanton slaugher of your compatriots, i give you this gift.
	
	However, I do still have need of skilled servents who bring results. So how do you feel about working for me off the books?
