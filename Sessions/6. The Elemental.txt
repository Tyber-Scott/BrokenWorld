				Arthas,
					What is Taking so long, you are running behind the schedule. You are lucky we found the calalyst or we would still be recovering from the *(^^ up with the lightning elemental for years.
					
					Good news though, With they powers in this calalyst we can almost go straight to the next stage, as it seems to be inbunded with not only lightning, but also thunder elemental and divine energy as well.
					
					All we need now is the Solar heart you have been cultivating and we are ready, Bring the Core to Caanan as soon as it is grown. I grow impatient with your delays and incompetence.

	-4-6 more cultists still around (Mainting guard on the walls)
	-Ideally they will rest before entering the tower, which will start of the boss fight.
		-Details of boss fight
	-I can see what happens next going quite a few ways
		- Return to the island they way they came
			-  they will be ambushed and captured by Wardens ship
		- Decide to do "Something" about the shrine/catalyst/cults base
		- Return the the Island by a different route
			- Roll for random encounters as usual
			
	No-matter what they choose when the players take a long rest of the next couple of days, the warlocks will have a conversation with their patrons. and the others will have various self reflections as they level up.
