What should be the over arching plot
	Their should probably be a bad guy im thinking baal cultists who want to bring about the end of the world
	But how much should the players figure out themselves
	
	General Flow of the story
	Lvl 1-4: Basic dogs bodys of the university, doing random errands that they choose, leveling up their gear and ship as well as getting some cool magical gear
			Should Hint at something bigger, have one or two run ins with cultists that leave some notes about whats happening, get them invested in stopping it.
			
			The Cultists plan is to build up stores of aetheric and elemental energy, and then combine them to form a avatar for their Ba'al. They need a mix of all the elements so that the avatar the god gets is stable
			
				Burnt Note---- ts hope this works better then our last attempt, Gegor swears that this will work but we can't cope with another disaster like last time, years of work down the drain, and that clockwork maniac getting word of things. I want you to make sure that this is the right way, do whatever you --- Burnt Note
				
			
				I Hear and Obey
				The Ritual will  be performed on the 4th waxing of the cresent moon, The catalyst we discovered has let us accelerate our timeline and if this test is succesful then nothing will be able to stop our Destiny
				
				We have made a incredible find, this shard seem's to be imbued with part of the power of a god. I do not know what this is origonally from but once Oin returns from his journey I will have to have him investigate further but it seems like we should be able to avoid collecting both lightning and thunder elemental cores as the powers inbuded in this shard should be sufficent
				
				As such, as soon as you finish harvesting the solar core, you are to return to Canaan and we can begin the ritual, the other cores are already on their way.

				[Rune]
				means high priest of Ba'al
				
				
				
			The players will run into Oin a traveling smith/merchant. Who will offer to buy the earthen elemental core from them.
			
			The cultists route is basically their are these cores that form in elementals, that acts as the centre of their power, the stronger the elemental the bigger the core. Very strong elementals have been hunted out of the habital altitudes, but to summon a god that is what they need, so they have been seeding these elemental cores in places where they can feed and grow, and then harvesting them once they have reached a sufficent size.
	Lvl 5: Should be invested enough and found out where the test ritual is occouring, they should try and hunt down the ritual and kill the avatar that was created, it will be a pale imitation of a god, and unfamilar with this reality, so won't be that strong. Either the players will kill it and force it to flee, or it will turn on the cultists and flee after beating the players
