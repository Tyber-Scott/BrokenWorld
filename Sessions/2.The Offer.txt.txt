Players will probably steal the ship unless i read the party wrong. If they do have Captain Morgan say he needs to get back to his son and family.

Tothway is a few days travel away, although not on the primary trade route that Richtowe is on it will be releticvly easy to find passage. When they get their they will be accepted along with Horus and Nehken by a senior indevidual who will start a lore dump
	
	***LORE DUMP HERE***
	
Once the lore is complete, or if the players look like they have started getting bored Toth'Tway will meander into the room that the players are in

	***Toth'Tway himself takes the form of a old man, with one mechanical arm that glows and whirs with whatever magical and mechanical componets provide it
	locomotion.***

He will say he overheard the conversation and what the players had done for his agents and would like to offer them a reward and a job. The reward will probably be a magical weapon or item for the party as well as 60 gold each. The job will be that while a researcher of the uni goes to investigate the shrine of baal their are a few other points of intrest, that need to be checked out and the university is constantly sending out teams to check these sites of magical energy to make sure that its not a behemoths covelesing and they need a group to protect their researcher on the trip, a ritual site or anything else dangerous. The players will have a few options as to which site they want to go to.

		Amidala: A mining town has been having reports of small elementals comming from the mines, this can be a sign of something more sinister.
			- Generic Murder Mission, the town is thankful, have some roleplaying opportunities, in the bottom of the cave they will find a crystal
		Lake of the Moon: Reports of a great being sleeping in the large lake in the middle of the island.
			- Find the great beast, researcher advises to not wake, that night cultists will attack.
			
If they decide not to go on one of the missions Toth'Tway will be disapointed, and say that he thought he had seen potential in them, he will suggest a tavern at the docks for them to stay at, where their will be a privateer Ussop recruiting men for his ship. "The Warden", a small sloop that is delivering a message to Neketara, which will require travel through pirate laden airs.
