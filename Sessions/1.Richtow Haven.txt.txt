Richtow Haven
The Campaign will start in Richtow Haven, a small village of maybe 20-30 people that sits on the trade route between Atum
(The Capital of the kingdom following the god of the same name ) and Hayris a large but independant city several weeks journey south. Most ships can make
the journey in a single go, not needing to stop to take on supplies, but enough small skiffs and Caravels ply the route as either hired protection for the 
bigger ships, messengers or small passenger vessels that a number of small villages have sprung up on the traderoute and make their living selling these
ships supplies.

One of the side effects of this small but constant flow of traffic through the island means that those who live their are far more wordly and aware of 
the greater events in the world then you would expect from such a small village and that the general affluence of the village, while not great, at least
ensures that nobody comes close to starving and that they can affort to have fun like bards and the like with greater frequency than you would expect. The 
players will start in the tavern (Why fix what ain't broke),which is both far larger and better stocked then one would expect from a small village, having 
arrived from a varity of different places and situations (Passenger of a ship currently stopping off, denizens of the island, travellers, mercenarys searching
for work, that kind of thing). When a single injured passenger with a aetheric life vest lands on the dock. 

Horus (The wounded passenger) enters the inn and hopefully the characters interact with him and he explains his plight, if not he will start mouthing off
and trying to recruit a group of people to help him.
	
	Turns out he was the owner of a small sky-skiff, one of the many that flitter between the islands for trade and messengers, and he had been hired by a local 
	engineer who was conducting a research project on a nearby island when his ship had been blown of course by the aetheric winds and crashed into a island,
	Unfortuantly for Horus this island was inhabited by goblins and upon crashing he was immedietly attacked by the creatures. Despite the face that his co-pilot
	was pinned upderneath the wreckage he was a pilot and not a fighter and had to take flight and flee.
	
Since the message he had been tasked with was of great import, as well as wanting to save the lift of Nehken, his copilot, he was going to hire one of the ferrys
to return to the island and was looking for a few warriors to help him kill the goblins.

They players will be on the sky-ferry for maybe a few hours at most, and then will deploy next to the destoyed ship. probably after investigating for a moment
the ground will collapse and the players will enter the dungeon

	{dungeon details here}
	
After clearing the dungeon and finding hints of a cult that worshipped great beasts called behemoths, including body parts, they will be asked to take the 
message to Toth'Tway as both Horus and Nehken are injured and will need to recouperate.

Assuming the players agree they can book room on a ship traveling to Toth'Tway, which is a minor university that is governed by a even more minor god Toth'way.
