Session 5
The players left the still un-named island base to go on Toth'Tways given mission.

Insizor found a shortcut which cut 3 days of the Journey
4 days in they flew out of some "Rapids" (A section of the realm where the arrangment of the island result in a stronger concentration of the aetheric winds) and saw a town on the left hand island called Mithrax.

The Curse crashed into a small skiff that was leaving the island, and after some abortive attempts at intimidation, engaged in combat with Warden and a crew member. They killed the crewmember and drove Warden away, but did not pursue.

They then burnt the skiff after looting supplies (Nothing significant) and fled low and fast.

Wardens ship did not appear to see them, but rocked up to investiage the now burning skiff.

The players then continued to the Ruins, and tried to sail in low and stealthy, but the watchers were very attentive and fired shots at them, they continued under the island and moared the Curse on the far side, with Cola scouting in bird form (Noticing around 10 Cultists in the area).

They snuck in, accidently drew the attention of two cultists, who patlass and Heracles drew into conversation.
	The cultists were confused and called for Frank, who appeaed to be the captain in charge of the defense these cultists.
	
	The players then quickly and relativly quietly slaughter the three of them.
	
Patlass and Heracles then dressed as Cultists and approached the next group (As seen by Cola) pretending to be those they had killed.
	Plan worked perfectly and when they were in melee range, killed both of them silently.
	
They then decided to disguise Edward and Kai as Prisnoers, and approach the tower, but before they could were seen by a Cultist in the main camp who called them over.

They went over, maintaining the deception until in practically melee range with Arthas, the priest/mage in charge, and slaughtered him and one of the other cultists, and knocked one out, possibly fataly.

Edward then cast Spare the Dying on him and they plan to interrogate him next session.
