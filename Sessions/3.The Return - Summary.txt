The players excited the mine and returned to the inn, they woke up the Innkeeper, scared some guests and slept in till noon. They players then woke up, and after noticing Bernie has slipped out at night, demanded he take them the the guards.

Bernie took them to the town hall, where the players were greated by a hostile mayor, who after being intimidated into complying summoned Kili to answer the parties questions. Kili turned up but thought the players were dicks so he didn't comply with their questions, and the players responded with kidnapping him. This turned into a fight and the players killed a guard, hog tied Kili but the mayor ran away.

Taking up the unconcious body of kili the players ran to the dock, were they were confronted by a angry harbour master and a group of 9 others blocking the path to the docks, since most of those blocking were of the older persuassion the players tried to barge through, but only some made it through.  This led to a confrontation on the docks, Liam breathed lightning over all of them, but that wasn't totally succesful, so they suggested a trade of Cal, who remained held, and Kili. They then tried to swap but the players cheated and once they got Cal back they kept Kili. This lead to his kid pleading for them to return his father but pat killed the kid in cold blood, the villagers then knocked pat of the dock but Insizor saved his life. 

They all then retreated to the ship and set off to no pursuit. On the way home they were attacked by a Keelboat but won the battle, looted the boat, finding a note and a encrypted navigation chart, and captured a cultist who was hiding on the outside of the boat.

They towed the boat back to Toth'Tway, Meeting the God on the docks who immedietly teleported them to his chamners. He was pissed that they had made such a masscre of the mission. But was assuaged slightly by the "gifts" of the boat and prisoners. Liam and Pat spoke back to him and he attempted to trap them both, but liam dodged. Recieving the Elemental Heart he let them stay the night and said he would have more words for them in the morning. Pat was trapped, suffocated until he blacked out. And he woke up on his bed with his right arm replaced to the elbow with a mechanical one as punishment for killing the kid and back talking.
