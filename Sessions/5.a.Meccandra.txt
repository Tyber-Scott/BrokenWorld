The elven Ruins of Meccandra are a sight to behold, the elves before the breaking were famed for their architecture with tall graceful towers dominating the skyline. Unfortuantly for the elves, while their building may have been tall and graceful, they were not resilient, and as such the breaking ruined them even more then the cities of humans, with the once beautiful cities becoming piles of rubble.

As the players get closer they see that paths have been created between the fallen ruins, clear signs that a group of people have moved into the island and made it their home. The nature of the ruined paths mean that the city has become a maze for the unwary, leading potential explorers into dead ends or trapped paths from which they never leave. 

Here and their random buildings rise up above the rubble. Where by magic, skill or luck, the managed to resist the damage that the Breaking had done their neigbours. Near the middle of the city, the central square remains unbowed. The magical protections the elves had ensured their survival.
