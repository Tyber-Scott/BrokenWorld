The Afterlife in the broken world is a rather complicated thing, and nobody really understands it. In universe it is thought that each god has a afterlife realm that is associated with them, and that when somebody who serves them dies, that they get taken to that realm. And those who die not serving a god are either taken by one of the gods of death, or their soul is returned to the chaos whence it came.

This is close to what actually happens in some sense, but really far away in others. Since gods are immortal, and they know that when they die they are returned to chaos, they don't really cares what happens to their followers souls, and even the more research inclined gods have not invested time into the truth of the matter, and take those who have died and been reserected at their words. A few of the death gods have spent the time to find out how it really works, or have a instictive knowledge of things, but due to the mechanics of it, they know that if they tell their followers how it all works. It would mean that nobody would have a afterlife anymore.

This is because all souls are consumed by chaos when they die, but due to a strange twist of fate, when mortals die, their belief shapes the chaos and forms small pocket dimensions of whatever they believe will happen to them in the afterlife, overtime those with similar beliefs are drawn into the same pocket dimensions resulting in a group belief of the afterlife that maintains itself. This mortal belief is so strong that it even has the ability to create "shadows", create beings who reflect people in the real world (Typically the gods themselves) who rule over, or serve those, in the afterlifes.

Since all gods power come from chaos, and these realms are in truth connected to their associated god by the beliefs on the humans, it results in a circumstance very similar to what people believe, and some gods have the power to reserect people.
