The Traveller. Goddess of Wanderers (Typically seen as meaning mercenaries)
The Traveller is one of the gods who survived the breaking. Most of the war gods were killed in the breaking as they could not resist the honour that fighting other gods offered, and were often the target for the other militaristic gods due to the fact they offered are far larger threat that other gods, both due to skill at warfare, personal power and a willingness to engage where others would not.

The Traveller survived, but not did not escape unhurt. The ravages of the Breaking, both the war and the destruction of the world that it caused, took a toll on her. And her physical form was broken, arms crushed by Oryx (A Rival war god who did not survive) and body shattered by the same forces that sundered the world. In the current day she is a minor figure in the politics of the world, a war god who can't fight has very few uses. She has gifted her powers to one of the Iron lord in a attempt to regain relevance, and while Saladin is feared and known across the realm, few know that she is behind him.

The Traveller lives in her broken fortress-monastary from before the breaking, although its marble walls and defenses were destroyed long ago, and its extremities cast of into the void, the central keep still clings to a chunk of rock. And despite her greatest servant rarelly visiting his mistress, she still is not defensless with her Guardians still garrisoning the keep, and even a broken war god has tricks up her sleeve.

Currently takes the form of a mummified woman, sitting in a throne made of pure white marble.
