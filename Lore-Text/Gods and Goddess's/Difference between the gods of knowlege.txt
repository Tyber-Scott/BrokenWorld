Differences between the Gods of discover/invention/knowledge ect.

Their are a lot of gods out their, so there is a great deal of crossover between gods and their realms. This page is their to explain the subtle differences between similar gods, in this case Toth'Tway, Hephestus, Mag'ladroth and The Libriaian.

The first difference is the biggest, T, H and M are more focused on the creation of new knowledge and the hording of old, where as the Libriaian does none of her own research and simple hoards, sorts and categorizes knowledge.

Between the other 3 gods the differences are more subtle. But basically what it comes down to is M is about the abstract knowledge, how the realitys of the world work. Their doesn't have to be a "real" need for the knowledge, he seeks it for knowledge's sake. Where as H and T care more for knowledge that can be practiced in the real world, new ways to craft and create. New things to do.

The differences between H and T are simply Focus, H practices and is a master of all forms of Creation, and is by far the more powerful god, both politically and personally, WHere as T chose one area of expertice and focused all his exploritory efforts and exploring that one field as far as he can.
