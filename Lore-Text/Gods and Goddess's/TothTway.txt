Toth'tway, God of Golems
A reletivly weak god in regards to raw power, but made up for it with preperation, has control over minor spacial magics and the ability to create life, or even sentience, out of mechanical beings. As with all gods has control over his size, although generally appears human out of practicality. His weapon of choice is a sentient spear he crafted himself. It activly tracks its target in the air and when it hits releases a swarm of tiny golems into the bloodstream of the target, shreading them from the inside.

Has a fondness for knowledge, although is predisposed to prefering practical discoverys and experimentation over book learning, often in his free time you will see him tinkering with a weapon, device or armour to try and get it to work a little better.

Had a Rival in Ba'al. The god of serpents as Ba'al found Toth'tways insistent need to invent and create as un-natural and Toth'tways found Ba'als inability to understand the consequences of his actions and his mistreatment of his followers as an insult. In the breaking the two fought many times, Ba'al ripped half Toth'tways body off but Toth'tway eventually managed to kill Ba'al and replaced his missing body with clockwork parts.
