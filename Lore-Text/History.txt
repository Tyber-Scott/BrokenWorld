The Broken World.
In The begining Only Chaos existed, a sea of rolling boiling potential. Time, physics, magic all had yet to exist. At one point a being arose, this had happened
before, and usually they were torn apart as quickly as they were created, but this one was special, he had a spark of power. His very nature forced the chaos
around him to take form and in a cacophanous sound it was forced into logic.

This split reality into four realms, each one a pure representation of a element,each seperate yet touching each other. the being, for he had no name yet saw 
what his presence had created and was happy, however he was unsatisfied as when ever he moved chaos would reclaim the realms behind him even as he formed
the raw chaos in the realms in front of him. 

The being started on a project, to combine the 4 elemental realms into One, like the hub of a great wheel that all the realms circled. Long story short he
did but sacrificed himself in doing it. The Shrine of the gods, as his place of sacrifice came to be known, became the centre of reality, the earth formed around
it. However such was the beings power that even dead he continued to create and his children, the gods, where born. infrequently gods would spring up from
the shrine, born in full adult form with knowledge and personality fully formed. gods could have children themselves, although these children only had a fraction
of the spark of divinity their parents did, and from these children the mortal races were created.

1000's of years ago the gods walked the earth.  They were worshipped by the tribes who lived on the planet, some gods stayed still and citys rose up around
 their dwelling places, but most were nomadic, moving between tribes and continents and bringing their gifts to the world. But then everything changed when
 Mephet'ran, The Messenger, was born. 

He was a creature of darkness, and the small skirmish's between tribes and even the larger conflicts between the stationary citys of the stationary gods
could not satisfy his lust for destruction. But Mephet'ran was a cunning god, and knew he was not powerful enough to destroy the world by himself. So
he became the Messenger, a god who flew like the wind a trusted source of information and knowledge across the entire word. His fame reached a point where
chieftans and gods insisted he would be the one to carry their messages because nobody else could be trusted to do it as quickly and reliably as him.

Using his position as a trusted Messenger he started to subtly change messages, not so much that you would notice without seeing the original and the altered
one side by side, but enough to start spreading distrust and discord. Over the course of many years Mephet'ran had split the world into factions, and even
the gods had taken sides, but he as not satisfied yet.The world was divided but not yet broken. Darkness ruled but light still had strongholds all over the 
world.

His next step was to strike the match, to ignite the war that would break the world into a Hundred thousand pieces that could never be assembled. However not
everything was going Mephet'rans way. Aza'gorod (The Architect) and Tsara'noga (The Source) had realized that someone was behind the growing darkness. And
although they didn't know who they knew that they couldn't let them get away with it. The two of them ,and the mortals who followed them, formed a significant 
enough bloc that Mephet'rans plan would not succeed while they maintained their alliance. He tried many plots and manipulations, both directly and through others
but the trust the two shared proved to strong.

Eventually it appeared that Mephet'ran overplayed his hand and Aza'gorod and Tsara'noga found out who was behind everything. However this was part of Mephet'ran 
plan. He knew that without the two gods to hold the allied tribes and citys together they would fall apart, and that without the peacekeeping efforts of the
alliance that all the bitterness, hatred and rivalrys he had built up and encouraged over the last several centuries would result in the war he so desperatly
sought. He also knew that Aza'gorod was one of the single most powerful gods in existance and they he could never take him alone, let alone with another, in
a straight fight.

With all this in mind Mephet'ran had sought a weapon from Mag'ladroth(The Dragon), a chronosphere that, while not able to kill the gods, would trap them in
stasis for all eternity. Unfortuantly a weapon of such power needed the Soul of a powerful god to power it, and Mephet'ran was the only god who was both powerful
enought and willing to give his soul for the cause.

So basically his plan worked, he tricked both his enemies into the Shrine of the Gods, the core of creation and the birth place of the first gods and triggered
the trap, sacrificing himself to ensure the destruction of the world. Over the next 100 or so years wars raged throughout the world, gods and mortals fighting 
and killing one another until the very earth broke under their feet. The world had not been designed for a god to unleash its full might without restraint, let 
alone the hundreds of gods who did so now. The earth, no longer a point of balance between the primordial forces, was pulled into the seperate elemental realms.
along with those mortals and gods who managed to survive.

Those mortals dragged into the realm of fire and water were quickly destroyed, their enviroments simply not able to sustain life, but a lucky few were taken to
the realms of Earth, where the chunks of the world formed caverns and caves, a massive interconnecting maze where they managed to make a living with the help
of the gods who had survived, and Air, where the chunks of earth formed a huge archipelgo of floating islands.

Once the dust had settled the surviving gods came to a realization, this could never happen again. Reality had almost broken irrepearably and could never be
returned to its former state. Even the relativly small displays of godly power they did in the realms of air and earth to create ecosystems capable of sustaining life almost breached the boundry of the primordial realms into chaos.

The only way gods could saftely exercize their power was to channel it through a mortal, whos very nature softened and difused the power into a manner the
realms could support. Over the next thousand or so years the realms restabilzed, civilization reformed and cultures aclimatized to their new reality, gods who
could no longer use their powers to protect themselves had to find humans willing to serve them to protect them, and civilizations rose up centered on gods.

Routes were discovered through the skins of reality between each of the four realms, and although it remained very dangerous to travel, communication was
established between the realms of earth and air.
