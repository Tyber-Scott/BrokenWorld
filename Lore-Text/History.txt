The Broken World

In the beginning, all that existed was chaos, a sea of rolling, boiling potential.
As of yet, time, physics and magic were not defined, as nothing had woven or formed such elements.
Amongst the chaos a being arose; such an event had occurred before, however the chaos usually tore these beings apart as quickly as they were formed. But not this one, he was special, within him burned a spark of power too great for the chaos to destroy. His very nature sculpted the chaos around him, compelling it to bend, stretch and take form. Finally with a cacophonous sound it was forced into logic.

This split reality, and from the fractured pieces four realms were formed, each one a pure representation of an element. The realms were separate and individual, yet remained connected to the other three via touch, positioned in formation together.
The being, for he had yet to be named, saw what his presence had created and was pleased. However, he quickly noticed that whenever he moved chaos would reclaim the realms in his wake, even as he shaped the raw chaos ahead of him, he grew unsatisfied with this phenomenon, and set about to change it. 

The being set about on a mission, his aim was to combine the four elemental realms into one, like the hub of a great wheel, which all the realms could then circle. But such a goal could not be achieved without sacrifice, so the being surrendered his very essence, to protect what he had created, and then ceased to be. The shrine of the gods, as his place of sacrifice came to be known, became the centre of reality, and the earth formed around it. 
However such was the spark of power within the being, that even in death it continued to create, and from this spark, his children, the gods, were born.

Intermittently gods would emerge from the base of the shrine, born in their full adult form, with their personality defined, and the gift of knowledge granted them. These gods could have offspring of their own, although the resulting children only had a fraction of the spark of divinity their parents did. It was from these children that the mortals were created.

Thousands of years ago, the gods walked the earth among us. They were worshipped and revered by the tribes who lived on the planet. Most of the gods were nomadic and preferred to move between tribes and continents, spreading their knowledge and gifts to the world. However not all preferred it this way, some gods chose to remain planted in one place, and cities quickly arose around their dwelling places. 

For a time all was peaceful, life was simple and unblemished.
This was until Mephet’ran, The Messenger, was born; it was from this point that everything began to change.

He was a creature formed from the darkness, one that craved destruction and turmoil. Towns began to have small feuds, some of which even grew into larger scale conflicts, between stationary cities and their resident gods. But not even these clashes could satisfy the hunger Mephet’ran had for chaos and carnage.

He was a being of great cunning, one who knew he was not powerful enough to tear the world apart by himself. Hence he became The Messenger, a god who flew faster than the wind, and was the trusted source of information, secrets and knowledge across the entire world. His fame reached the point where chieftains and gods alike, insisted upon him being the one to carry their trusted messages, for no one could match his speed or reliability.

Using his position as a trusted messenger, he started to subtly change the wordings of certain messages. It began small, where he would only alter one word or so, just enough to plant a seed of distrust, but not enough to be caught by those who were sending or receiving these messages. 
Over time he grew bolder, and would alter entire sentences, which went unnoticed amongst the growing friction and resulting discord.

Over the course of many years Mephet’ran had single-handedly split the world into factions, even the gods had taken sides, and yet he was still unsatisfied. The world was divided but it had not yet fallen. Darkness reigned supreme, relishing and growing amongst the chaos and hatred. However there were still places that upheld the light, and these strongholds stood steadfast against the growing darkness.

Mephet’ran’s next step was to strike the match, which would ignite the conflict he had carefully nurtured into existence, turning it into a war. It would be the final blow that would shatter the world into a hundred thousand pieces, with no hope of being reassembled.

However not everything was going according to his plan. Aza’gorod (The Architect) and Tsara’noga (The Source) had realized that someone was behind the growing power of the darkness. And although they had no idea who that might be, they knew that they couldn’t sit idly by and let the darkness swallow the light. The two of them together, along with the mortals that followed them, formed an alliance, one that was strong enough to rival Mephet’ran’s plan. Whilst their alliance stood, he was doomed to fail.

Mephet’ran attempted to separate the two through the use of conspiracies and manipulations, both directly and through others, but the alliance between the two, and the trust they shared proved too strong.

In desperation Mephet’ran appeared to overplay his hand, revealing to Aza’gorod and Tsara’noga that he was behind the growing darkness. However this was yet another trick of The Messenger, who knew that without the two gods to hold the allied tribes and cities together, they would quickly be swept up in the bitterness, hatred and rivalry he had carefully constructed over the last several centuries. 
He knew that if the two gods were taken off the playing board, the alliance would fall quickly into disarray, resulting in the war Mephet’ran so desperately craved.

However he knew this task would not prove an easy one, for Aza’gorod was considered to be one of the most powerful gods in existence, one he could never dream of matching in combat, and that was without the help of Tsara’noga.  

Bearing all this in mind Mephet’ran sought out a weapon from Mag’ladroth (The Dragon), he knew he could not beat Aza’gorod in a straight brawl, but could certainly outmatch him with his cunning.
A weapon that came to be known as the chronosphere was created, whilst it was not able to kill the gods, it had the ability to trap them in stasis for all eternity. 
But to power such a mighty weapon, unfortunately required the soul of a powerful god to be sacrificed. 

Mephet’ran lured both Aza’gorod and Tsara’noga to the shrine of the gods, the central pillar of creation and the birthplace of the first gods. The two allied gods believed they had cornered their enemy, and were about to destroy him, when The Messenger triggered his trap, imprisoning both of his enemies within the weapon. Mephet’ran knew that he had the capacity to bring the chronosphere to life; hence in his war bent state he willingly gave up his soul to power such a device, laughing as he perished, knowing he had just ensured the destruction of the world. 

Over the course of the next hundred years or so, wars raged throughout the world, gods and mortals alike were slain, until the very earth gave out from under their feet. The earth had not been designed to withstand the full might of a gods power unleashed without restraint, let alone the hundreds of gods that did so. The earth became a wasteland, scarred by the conflicts that its history had left behind. No longer a place of balance between the primordial forces, earth was pulled into the separate elemental realms, along with those the mortals and gods who had survived the onslaught.

The mortals who were dragged into the realms of fire and water quickly perished; as such environments had not been designed to sustain life. A lucky few found themselves in the realms of Earth, where the jagged pieces of the world had formed a collection of caverns and caves, which together had created an interconnecting maze; it was here that the survivors managed to scrounge themselves up a living with the help of the gods who had survived.

Of the mortals that found themselves in the realms of Air, where the fragments of the world collected together to form a large-scale archipelago of floating islands, it was here that they too managed to scrounge out a living assisted by the surviving gods that had come to the realm with them.

Once the dust settled, the surviving gods looked around at the destruction that had been inflicted, and they were deeply saddened by the broken world, that is when the heavy weight of guilt began to set in. Hence those that had survived swore such a thing could never be allowed to happen again. Reality itself had almost broken, and it was frightening to realize how fragile the boundary between the primordial realm and chaos had become, if it had shattered it would have meant the end of existence. Even the small displays of godly power, used to create ecosystems capable of sustaining life within the realms of air and earth, almost breached the boundary.

It was no longer safe for the gods to exercise their powers as they had done so in ages past. It was clear to them that the only way to prevent the boundary from shattering, was for the gods to channel their power through a mortal, whose very nature softened and diffused the power into a state the realms could support.

Over the course of the next thousand or so years, the realms managed to restabilise themselves and make some recovery from the conflicts of the past. Civilisations were reformed and cultures quickly acclimatized to their new found reality. The gods who could no longer use theirs powers to protect themselves had to seek out humans willing to serve them, and protect them. Civilisations centered upon the various surviving gods rose up, and society returned to as normal a state as it could. 

Soon routes were discovered through the overlapping pockets of reality between each of the four realms, and although it remained very dangerous to travel, communication was established between the realms of Earth and Air.
