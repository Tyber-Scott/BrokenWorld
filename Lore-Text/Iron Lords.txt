The Iron lords are a loose conglomerate of pirates who live in the realm of air. The have no central rule, or even a strict code of ethics, but any new members must be accepted by at least two thirds of the currently sitting iron lords so over time a set of loose values has formed, basically while stealing is ok excessive slaughter and brutality doesn't help anybody and can bring down the military in great force, like  happened with Gol. D Rodger.

At the moment their are 8 sitting iron lords, and possibly another 20 or 30 captains that pledge alligence to the iron banner. Any of the iron lords can accept a pledge of alligence, but to become a iron lord it requires the vote, and they know that if they let in unprestigious people their prestige will fall so they have incredibly high standards when it comes to accepting new members

historically they were called the iron lords because it was origonally an allience of 2 Warforged captains, as their fame grew and the respect of their methods with it others sort to join the conglomerate, they accepted anybody who was worthy, so soon the flesh mortals outnumbers the Iron lords but the name stuck

Notable Iron Lords include

	Hawkeye (Hexblade Warlock)
	- Notable for not having a crew, he opperates a single skiff that is piloted by a bound spirit, He is unparrelelled in his skill with the aetheric 
		parachute and blade, and often the distictive coffin shaped skiff and a single shadow leaving it to fly towards your ship is enough to cause them to surrender.
	- Is rumoured to live in the ruins of one of the kingdoms of the old world
	
	Don Flamingo (Monk)
	- A black market dealer of weapons and armour, in mundane, arcane, and holy forms. Is a large part of the reason the Iron lords are such a force to 
		be reckoned with as their arms, armour and ships are better maintained and better quality then most of the merchant ships and mercenery defenders that they come across
	- Doesn't really like the whole piracy thing, and prefers to let other fight his battles for him, but in order to maintain his possion among the Iron lords
		he does get out and about to "keep his feet wet" as it were.
	
	Edward Teach (Warrior)
	Quite Simply the single most powerful man alive, while others rely on external forces to grant them power, be it a patron, god or technology, Whitebeard Simply relys on his own skill at arms and force of will. The only man to have ever beaten Hawkeye in a duel he wields a glave that rumour says he swings with enough force to cause sonic waves as it passes
	His crew look to him as a father figure, and he has the greatest number of Banner lords serving him. He is a firm believer in freedom and honour, often risking himself because honour demanded it, although when you are as skilled as him very rarely do you chances catch up with you.	
	
	Tempest (Storm Cleric)
	- High priest of Scylla, a god of storms. Scylla takes the form of a hydra in uncharted regions in the high altitude bands of the realm. Scylla was 
		wounded deeply in the breaking, and has been reduced to nothing more than a mindless beast, lashing out with her power at anything close. Normally this would tear 	a hole in reality, a god unleashing their full potential, but that is where Tempest comes in. Due to Scylla's mindless nature she has no control over the flow of her power, and as long as Tempest is draining the power reality stays safe. Tempest is truly loyal to his god, and has served her from before the breaking, he will not let anybody know her location lest somebody try and take a more reliable (and permenant) solution.
	-Due to the nature of his power, Tempest is prone to almost gratuitous displays, never using one spell where 3 could do. Unlike practically every other 
		ship in the sky, Tempest's ship, Charbois, is not powered by the aetheric winds, but rather by Tempest himself. This of course means that he can never long stray for from his ship lest if fall from the sky. This is not nessesarily a bad thing however, as it means that convential magical means for detecting ship based on the aetheric winds are useless against it, and the ship can travel places that ships using the more traditional methods of travel can't reach.
	
	Saladin (Paladin, Oath of conquest)
	- Others are members of the Iron lords, but Saladin IS the Iron lord, despite being flesh and blood Saladin is the one the public think of when they here
		the of the Iron lords, with a unrelenting love for warfare and a obsession with proving he and his are the strongest in the skys, Saladin drives his men at a unrelenting pace. His men are the best trained and best equipped of all the Iron lords as their constant raiding has given them far more experience and wealth then the other lords.
	- Nobody knowns how Saladin can keep up this pace, as even immortals would struggle with sailing from target to target without a break, but the rumour is
		Saladin and his first Mate, Shax , are a paladin and cleric respectivly of one of the surviving war gods. Known Simply as the Traveller.
	
	Shrike (Barbarian Beserker)
	- One of the origonal members of the Iron lords along with Trazyeen. Had been around so long that even he cannot remember where or why he was created, 
		but it was definatly before the breaking. Acts as a gentleman out of combat, believing in honour and the code of chivalry. But in combat he is a fiend, a mindless blur of violence and murder. Originally formed the Iron lords as a way of restricting his darker urges as he knew that without external motivation he would continue to sink into the violent rages.
	
	
	Captain Moriah (Necromancer Wizard)
	- A lych who captains a crew of undead, his lieutenant's are mostly the more powerful forms of undead, with vampires, warlocks, death-knights and the like.
	- The menial labour of his crew is zombies and skeletons, although unlike most peoples image of a necromancer or lych he doesn't reanimate his foes 
		to fight for him, unless they ask for it, but instead charges the towns, villages and trade routes he rules a tithe of corpses. He does this as willing subjects both increase the effectiveness of the undead, but also stops his enemies using that fear against him, as those fighting for their very souls are far less likely to surrender then those fighting for somebody elses wealth.
	- As well as being a Iron lord he is actually a soverign in his own right and has a small holding of a few small islands.
	
	Trazyeen (Artificer)
	- The other one of the founding members of the Iron lords, has also been around from before the breaking but not in his current body. A genius of 	
		technology and engineering Trazyeen was originally a human but built himself a metal body once his own started failing him, since then he has been constantly upgrading and improving his metal body, and his ship, "The Scepulctre of Iron", has a collection of his outdated forms
	- Crew is pretty normal, although definetly steam punk themed with the general love of technology. The Scepulctre is arguably the most technologically
		advanced ship in the skys, although it is far from the most reliable, with the constant tinkering and modifications meaning that it can break down for days or even weeks at a time
