Dæmons and Devils

Devils are the Mortals and divines who absorbed the power of Angron and were corrupted by it, turning them into foul, evil shadows of themselves, many were driven insane by the sudden influx of power, and those that wern't still faced corruption, just more slowly. 

Only Dalinar had the personal fortitude, and the strength of will, to hold the infestation at bay. And even he cannot cleanse himself from it completely.

Although no solid records from before the breaking about the Devils exist, some claim there were as many as several hundred, although by the time of the actual break, and the spliting into 4 worlds, only 9 are known to have survived. Compared to the power of there Prigenitor they were nothing, but were still a match for all the gods who had survived the breaking. No Contact has been made with the realm of water since the breaking, so some might reside their, but in the realms of Air, Earth and Fire 4,3,2 survived respectivly.

They suffer the same penalties as Divines for using their power, and so seek servents amoung the mortals to serve their goals. 

Dæmons are creatures of the void, formed by the emotions of those in the material world, they are creatures of passion. basically 40k Dæmons but less powerful and less evil.
