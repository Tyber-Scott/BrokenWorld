Agriculture
While the enviroment of the realm of air wasn't immedietly fatal to the mortals who were sent there its enviroment did cause some issues. The lack of water
and small land mass of the majority of the islands meant that initally the islands couldn't really support life, and certainly not the few citys that had
been pulled through. The only reason that the entire mortal population didn't starve was two fold. First the natural wildlife of the realm, which seemed
to live of the aetheric winds themselves, were edible, and second the gods. In a act that nearly sent the realm spiraling back into the primordial chaos, 
the gods that had survived came together and reshaped parts of the realms, creating endless water sources on many of the islands, and making trees and grains
viable to grow in the new conditions.

Most big city islands are surrounded by many small farms that work to provide it with the raw material it needs to grow, sky-fishermen also make a living on
selling both native animals to the realm, as well as birds that had been pulled across when the world broke. 

Ecosystem
Many animals were not able to survive on the small islands that they found themselves on and starved to death, but some managed to evolve to their new reality,
the gods reshaping of the land helped matters as any species that had survived that long was mutated into a form more suited to survival on the islands. Generally
taking the form of a slower metabolism, the ability to subsist on aetheric energy, or the ability to jump between close together islands.

Plants had a similar issue, although to a lesser extent, and were also reshaped to suit the enviromet more.

Resources.
The mineral resources of the world were more exposed then ever, and it made mining a even more productive endevour, the ability to just drill into the side of
a island and immedietly get to the veins of mineral you were looking for was great.
