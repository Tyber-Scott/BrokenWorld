The braking had many strange effects on the mortals of the realm, the deaths and shatterings of so many gods had caused certain blood lines to be infected/blessed/cursed with some portion of a gods powers.

How this effects the bloodline has many different forms. In some it changes and warps the forms and minds of the entire bloodline, turning them into insane and desperate creatures as the gods power tears them up from the inside, in others it is a blessing granting them powers and wisdom beyond those that mortals typically posses.

One rare side effect is that the power is supressed for many generations, and then comes to the fore in a particular child, sometimes at birth, sometimes after a stressful or intense activity. This change causes their form to change in the image of their god. and sometimes even hear their god talking to them from beyond the grave.
