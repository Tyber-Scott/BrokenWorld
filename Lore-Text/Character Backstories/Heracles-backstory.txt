I remember the day it all changed. In one single day, I went from privileged noble-born boy with a world of potential, able to do anything I want with my life, into an abomination. I woke early in the morning, to my parents waking me up, terrified at the vision before them. I had been screaming in my sleep and opened my eyes to reveal luminous and glimmering. Turns out I was a Celestial, and my guide, Mykiel, had decided it was time for me to fulfill my 'destiny'. 
 
My father, a man with many hidden contacts, quickly got in contact with a dark figure who said he could change my eyes, but at a cost. I would have to make a deal with an unseen presence, taking it on as my patron and being a force for its will on the world. I had no say, my parents made me, and my eyes returned to normal. But that night as I dozed off, I felt darkness absorb my mind, as my eyes turned to dark voids. Ashamed, my parents outcast me and I accepted my fate, but the others didnâ€™t. My fiendish patron and the stern and vengeful Mykiel both forcing me to stay alive and guide me on their inverted paths. 
 
Five years have passed, and my powers have grown, but my control over my guides has not. Between them, I do not even know who I am anymore, but I fear the future as both tell me I am the "herald of the journey".
