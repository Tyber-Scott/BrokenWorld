Toth'tway University
Toth'tway University is a marvel of spatial magic and engineering, origonally it was a simple school where Toth'tway and his accolyes could stay safe and study. Toth'tways golem army managed to ensure their safty and overtime the wealth bought in by selling said golems, as well as the trade that passed through the area resulted in the university outgrowing the island it was on and having to spread to several of the other smaller islands close by.

Now the nature of floating islands is that while they remain relativly still compared to each other, they can still move 10's of meters in any direction based on the aetheric currents on any particular day. Needless to say this makes briding between islands rather difficult.
	In General there are 3 solutions to this
		1. Build very strong, sturdy bridges that can hold the islands in place against the aetheric currents
		2. Build flexible, extensible bridges that can cope with the change in length and orientation
		3. Avoid the need to build bridges

Toth'tway went with the 3rd approach, he built a series of eleborate mechanical doors that could connect to each other directly without having to pass through the intermediate space, originally their were just one on each of the islands, but as Toth'tway and his accolytes are prone to do he continued to tinker and improve the design, and eventually replaced almost every door on the islands with one of these portals, meaning that those who know what they are doing can get from anywhere to anywhere else in the university in seconds, resulting in a very efficently run Uni, while those who are inexperienced can find themselves trapped, unable to connect to where they want to go.
